    "text": "Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Political Science Department of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Additionally, I am a Graduate Fellow at the Global Diversity Lab.\nI study American politics, with a primary focus on Latino political behavior. Broadly, I am interested in Latino identity as a pan-ethnic category and how diversity within the Latino community can shape how Latinos engage with politics. Additionally, I have interests in survey methodology and local politics.\nBefore graduate school, I worked as a campaign pollster at Lake Research Partners and opposition researcher at Spiros Consulting. I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science and a minor in Latin American Studies from Washington University in St. Louis.\nIn my free time, I love to cook, go to shows, and watch movies. If you happen to be curious about what I’m listening to or what movies I’ve recently watched here is my last.fm and Letterboxd\nPlease feel free to reach out if there’s anything you want to chat about!"
