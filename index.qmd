::: {#about-block}
:::

Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the <a href="https://polisci.mit.edu" target="_blank">Department of Political Science</a> Department of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Additionally, I am a Graduate Fellow at the <a href="https://globaldiversitylab.mit.edu/people/" target="_blank">Global Diversity Lab</a>.

I study American politics, with a primary focus on Latino political behavior. Broadly, I am interested in Latino identity as a pan-ethnic category and how diversity within the Latino community can shape how Latinos engage with politics. Additionally, I have interests in survey methodology and local politics.

Before graduate school, I worked as a campaign pollster at Lake Research Partners and opposition researcher at Spiros Consulting. I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science with a minor in Latin American Studies from Washington University in St. Louis.

In my free time, I love to cook, go to shows, and watch movies. If you happen to be curious about what I'm listening to or what movies I've recently watched here is my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/alefrydman" target="_blank">last.fm</a> and <a href="https://letterboxd.com/alejandrofrydm/" target="_blank">Letterboxd</a>

Please feel free to [reach out](mailto:afrydman@mit.edu) if there's anything you want to chat about!
